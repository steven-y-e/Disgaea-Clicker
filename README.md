# Disgaea-Clicker

Disgaea Clicker is my attempt at making a "clicker game" loosely based on the "Disgaea" role-playing game series.  It is built using Bootstrap and JavaScript.  Key visual assets are sprite rips from "Disgaea D2".  My main goal was to design a clicker game that could be easily played through a mobile smartphone browser, since many browser-based clicker games aren't designed with responsive UIs, making them less desirable to play on mobile devices.
